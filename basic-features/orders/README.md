# Orders

Once your shop is online (i.e. you have an active [Order Cycle](../shopfront/order-cycle/)), customers are able to place orders. This section explains how to:&#x20;

* [manage and modify orders](view-orders.md)
* [create orders manually for customers](create-orders-manually.md)
* [adjust payments](refunds-and-adjusting-payments.md) (refunds etc.)
* print [receipts](broken-reference).
